# Titanic - ML from Disaster

Overview
This project is an exploration into the tragic sinking of the Titanic, one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to predict which passengers survived the disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, and more. This project is part of the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster."

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to apply machine learning models to predict survival outcomes for the passengers of the Titanic. By analyzing the dataset provided by Kaggle, we seek to understand the factors that contributed to the likelihood of survival and build a predictive model with high accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset is split into two parts:

Training set (train.csv): Contains passenger details and a survival indicator.
Test set (test.csv): Contains passenger details without the survival outcome, which is to be predicted.
Key features include:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name, Sex, Age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data distributions and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to better capture the predictive power of the data.
Model Selection: Evaluating several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Using cross-validation and evaluation metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall) to select the best model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model parameters for optimal performance.
Prediction: Making predictions on the test set.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Main programming language used.
Pandas/Numpy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the libraries mentioned above.
Open the Jupyter Notebooks (Titanic_EDA.ipynb for exploratory data analysis and Titanic_Model.ipynb for model building and evaluation).
Run the cells in the notebook to replicate the analysis and predictions.
Results
Our best model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the training set and YY% on the test set (as per Kaggle's evaluation). The insights and the detailed analysis of model performance are documented in the notebooks.
